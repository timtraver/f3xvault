Todo list for rcvault project

  when a pilot is added to an event and adds a plane, add the plane to their my pilot profile if it doesn't exist.
  ditto with the location of the event
  
X event config parameters for each event type

  event round adding and entering
X make event subroutine to get all info about an event get_event_info
  
  ability to create flying order F3F and maybe have an option to stagger each round
  ability to create F3B distance orders before hand
  
X  Ability to see other pilot profiles with their basic info and search (don't show email) under my pilot profile
X  Change My Pilot Profile to Pilot Profiles with My as the first selection, and others as the second
X  Add my club associations to my list
X  Add club associations to pilot profile
