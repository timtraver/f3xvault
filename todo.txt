Todo list for rcvault project

  when a pilot is added to an event and adds a plane, add the plane to their my pilot profile if it doesn't exist.
  ditto with the location of the event
  
X event config parameters for each event type

X event round adding and entering
X make event subroutine to get all info about an event get_event_info
  
  ability to create flying order F3F and maybe have an option to stagger each round
  ability to create F3B distance orders before hand
  
X  Ability to see other pilot profiles with their basic info and search (don't show email) under my pilot profile
X  Change My Pilot Profile to Pilot Profiles with My as the first selection, and others as the second
X  Add my club associations to my list
X  Add club associations to pilot profile
   
X  Add My events list to my profile
  
X  Add RC Clubs section!
  
X fix fancybox view on club locations

  make it so that when you add a location from somewhere else, that it takes you back to that screen
  ditto for plane
  
  make the ajax lookup not go through the main script, but be lean and faster
  
  reflights for groups
  
  team standings
  
  printable reports for rounds, and overall standings
  
  Change orientation of round flights with mutiple flights to vertical instead of horizontal and show better field descriptors and Round Ranks
  	and sort by groups or flight order for ease of entering! Maybe even show team names...
  
  Figure out drops
  
X As they are entering pilots, set the default entry order
  
  Put collapses on the sections of the event so you can easily see the different areas.
  
X  set autocomplete off for inputs of times...
  
  set tab order on entry fields with tabindex
  
  add DNS and DNF options to entry
  
  Outline round winners somehow
  
  On round entry screen, make a checkbox to allow for entries to be saved after each entry, or enter them all at once for offline entering
  also make it so that it tabs down to the next blank entry
