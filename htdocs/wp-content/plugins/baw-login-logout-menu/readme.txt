Visit your navigation admin menu page, you got a new box including 3 links, 'log in', 'logout', 'log in/logout'.
Add the link you want, for example "Log in|Logout"
1. You can change the 2 titles links, just separate them with a | (pipe)
1. You can add a page for redirection, example #bawloginout#index.php This will redirect users on site index.
1. You can add 2 pages for redirection, example #bawloginout#login.php|logout.php This will redirect users too.
1. For this redirection you can use the special value %actualpage%, this will redirect the user on the actual page.

You can also (since 1.1) add 3 shortcodes inyour theme template or in your pages/posts. just do this :
For theme : `<?php echo do_shortcode( '[loginout]' ); ?>`
In you posts/pages : `[loginout]`

The 3 shortcodes are "[login]", "[logout]" and "[loginout]".
You can set 2 parameters, named "redirect" and "edit_tag".
Redirect: used to redirect the user after the action (log in or out) ; example : "/welcome/" or "index.php"
Edit_tag: used to modify the <a> tag, ; example " class='myclass'" or " id='myid' class='myclass' rel='friend'" etc

You can also modify the title link with [login]Clic here to connect[/login] for example
