						Many of us fly for the sheer joy of flying, but there are also many that are addicted to the friendly competitions that we have with our planes. After a competition,
						the person that volunteered to do the scoring would have to blast an email containing some spreadsheet or scribbled notes about who won.<br>
						<br>
						This portion of the RC Vault is dedicated to the scoring of events. I currently have programming for scoring F3B, F3F, F3J, F3K and TD contests along with all the cool
						statistics that I could think of to go along with them. I have made it so that a user can create an event and give access for other users to edit the event so that
						others can help out those people that may be busy. I have also tried my hardest to make the input of the data quick and efficient so that you don't have 
						to spend hours after a tiring day inputting data.<br>
						<br>
						I have also made a series section to be able to link events together to make a best of series.<br>
						<br>
						This site can be used for live contests as long as you have an internet connection at the site. I hope to one day have an off line version for those sites that don't have 
						internet connections, and also to have a system to run a contest control board, live timing and announcing.<br>
						<br>
						Wouldn't it be cool to watch the world championships as they happen?<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						
						Please, let me know if I have gotten anything wrong with the calculations, as some of these disciplines are tricky.<br>
