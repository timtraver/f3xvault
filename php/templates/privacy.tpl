			In order to satisfy anyone using the site, I have developed an "official" privacy policy that describes all the technical stuff. The gist of it is that this site has no intention of selling any data it collects, or giving out any email addresses to anyone, period.<br>
			<br>
			Any notifications that you may get from the system will be from the system, or from other users of the system, and will not come directly to you as to preserve the privacy of your email address.<br>
			<br>
			Without further ado, here's the official policy with legal sounding garbledy gook...
