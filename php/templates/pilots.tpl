						There are RC pilots all over the world, and in creating the competition database, storing basic pilot info for ease of entry was crucial. In this area you may be able to find pilots
						in your area that share your passion, or see what kind of planes are being flown by the top pilots.<br>
						<br>
						I do not store any personal information that may get sold to outside sources, and as a pilot, you even have the ability to lock your information so that nobody can even see where you like to
						fly...
