						<h3>Where Are You?</h3>
						You have stumbled upon a storage vault of information about RC Model Flying. It includes databases for flying locations, planes, competitions, and clubs and all related data.
						<h3>What can you do here?</h3>
						You can view and most importantly contribute to the knowledge base of our flying sports. A database is only as good as the data that you put in it, so fill it up!!!
						<h3>How can I start?</h3>
						You can start by registering or simply logging in. You do not have to be a member to view the data, but if you wish to contribute, then you must create and account with us.

						<h3>From the Author</h3>
						<p style="padding-left:10px">
						Welcome to my web database of all things RC Flying. It wasn't very long ago that I started this hobby, and as I have increased my passion for it, I noticed that it was difficult to find information about where to fly,
						what planes are out there and the results of many competitions. In my research, I have found remnants of information in scattered places, but many are dead end links because the people that gathered that info have 
						had life intervene and haven't been able to add to them or keep them up to date.<br>
						<br>
						That is why I decided to create a skeleton database that can be populated by all the people that know the answers. (That's you!)<br>
						<br>
						I started out building a place to store all of the results of contests, and it grew out of control from there. I needed the location of events, so I made a location database. Then I wanted to know the planes that the pilots
						flew, so I created the plane database. Then the clubs they were associated with, and it just kept going!<br>
						<br>
						It has been a challenging web site to build (especially the competition scoring programming) and is still in progress, but I am having fun creating it, and hope that the community at large will find it useful and fill it up
						with the data that only they know!<br>
						<br>
						Please let me know if there is anything that you might find useful to include or change, and I will try to incorporate it.<br>
						<br>
						Happy Flying!<br>
