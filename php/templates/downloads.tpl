	<h4>Instructions For Installation</h4>
	<ol style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 14px;">
		<li>Select the proper download link above for your computer operating system.</li>
		<li>Uncompress the zip file to a convenient location like your desktop. You must leave the contents of the folders intact and start the application from within the folders.</li>
		<li>If you are using Windows 10 or higher, I highly recommend you download the registry import to add the cortana voices to your system. The base system voices are not that great, and if you install these files, you will get at least the nice Cortana Eva voice to use. Uncompress that zip file and double click on each voice. This will change some registry settings to allow third party apps to use the Cortana voices.</li>
		<li>Click on the glider icon to start the application. (For MacOS, you will need to right-click -> Open to open the application the first time)</li>
		<li>It starts out at the main menu.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<h4>Using the application</h4>
	<br>
	I would suggest you open the application and read along with these paragraphs to get familiar with the functionality of the program.<br>
	<br>
	<ol style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 14px;">
		<li>Home Screen : 
			<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">The home screen is simple in it has only three buttons. One that will allow you to search for events you have already set up in f3xvault.com, one that will take you to the manual timing screen, and a donation button. Please Donate! :) This screen now has an interenet connection status that will be green if you have an internet connection. It will also turn the Search button green if you have an active session.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>Search Screen : 
			<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">The search screen is also very simple. It allows you to search for events in the f3xvault system so that you can download the draw and pilots and create a playlist for that event. You can search on discipline type (f3k, f5j, etc), and you can also search for a string of the name of the event. Simply click on the row of the event you want to load, and it will take you to the main event screen.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>Event Screen :
			<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">The event screen has the following areas :
				<ul>
					<li> Top And Title Area
						<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
							Across the top of the screen is the logo, the name of the event, and at the top right are the fields you can set for the pilots meeting time and the start of the event :
								<ul>
									<li>Pilots Meeting Field
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											If you enter a time here (and do not have  "Send Time to clock when system is idle" selected), the system will show a countdown to the pilots meeting, and every 5 minutes will announce when the pilots meeting is. Once the time is reached it will sound the horn and explain that the pilots meeting is beginning and to come to the organization table. This field needs to be entered in 24 hour time (like 09:00) This can now be simplified by not using the full four digits and colon. You can just type in 900 for 9 a.m.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Contest Starts Field
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											If you enter a time here (and do not have  "Send Time to clock when system is idle" selected), the system will show a countdown to the start of the contest AFTER the pilots meeting time has passed, and every 5 minutes will announce when the contest will start. Once the time is reached it will sound the horn and explain that the contest will begin. It will then automatically start the generated playlist at the designated queue entry. This field also needs to be entered in 24 hour time (like 09:00) This can now be simplified by not using the full four digits and colon. You can just type in 900 for 9 a.m.
										</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li> Pilot List Area
						<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
							On the left hand side of the window is the pilot list of this event.
								<ul>
									<li>Top Speaker
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											Clicking on the speaker icon in the top pilot header bar will speak each pilot's name which will allow you to see if the voice you have chosen pronounces the pilots names correctly.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Pilot Speakers
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											Each of the pilot entries has a speaker next to it where you can test and edit the pronunciation of that pilot. Clicking on the speaker icon will open a small window below the pilot list that will allow you to edit the pronunciation of the pilot. You can enter phonetic spellings of their name, test the voice saying it, and if you like it, save that pilot's pronunciation. It will not change the name of the pilot anywhere. It will just change the pronunciation when being said in flight groups. Press the cancel button to close the window, or Save to save that voice. This will only save it on this computer.
										</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li> Draw Area
						<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
							Next to the pilot list scroll on the right is the round draw of the contest. This simply shows the draw of the contest. This draw area now has a spot for a green or red icon if the pilots have entered scored in the self scoring screens or not. It gets refreshed every new round, and the draw pane now moves to the same round that is being announced in the playlist.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li> Sound And Voice Preferences
						<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
							In the middle of the screen is the Sound and Voice Preferences area. If changes are made to any of these preferences, you do not have to regenerate the playlist for them to be in effect.
								<ul>
									<li>Horn
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											Selecting the horn list will allow you to select from some different horn types. Some horns can be better heard through particular sound systems. When you select a horn, a test horn audio will occur, allowing you to hear the horn you have chosen.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Language
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											The language list allows you to select a language of voices that you have installed on the computer. Sometimes this will translate some of the spoken phrases like numbers, so you can choose your native language and hear some phrases natively. This selection will also change the voice selection depending on what different voices you have installed on your machine.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Voice Selection
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											Once you have selected the language, this will give you the list of voices installed on your computer that can be used by external applications. As I had mentioned in the installation area, if you download the registry files for Windows, you can add the Cortana Eva voice to your machine (english) that is a much better quality voice than the default voices that come with windows. The MacOS has an extensive list of voices that can be downloaded. They are located in the Settings -> Accessibility -> Spoken Text area in the settings (You can download additional voices by selecting to edit the list in the voice list and download nice voices. My Favorite is Ava)
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Test Voice
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											After selecting a voice, you can hear an example of the voice by pressing this button.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Preload Voice Cache
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											Pressing this button will load the audio cache with all of the phrases used when speaking. This will allow them to be said quicker and  they will land on the proper seconds. This is particularly necessary on Windows machines, as the Text To Speech engine on windows is very slow in generating the audio. Press this button and it will show a loading screen that loads all the voices. It will disappear when it is finished. If for some reason it is taking too long and stuck, then you can cancel it and try again.
										</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li> Playlist Preferences
						<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
							In the middle of the screen is the Playlist Preferences area. These preferences are usually set before creating the playlist, but the last two can be set on the fly.
								<ul>
									<li>Announce Tasks
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											This checkbox will announce the particular tasks at the beginning of each group. It will say the full explanation of the task. Changes to this playlist for this parameter will only take effect when the playlist is regenerated.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Announce Pilots
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">

										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Prep Time
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">

										</p>
									</li>
									<li>45s Test Flight Window (F3K)
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											For F3K, this will insert a queue entry of 45 seconds for flight testing time as per the f3k rules of 2020.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>1m No Fly Window (F3K)
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											For F3K, this will insert a queue entry of 1 minute for a no fly period before the start of the working window.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Use Landing Window
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											For F3K, the landing window is 30 seconds. For F3J, F5J, and TD this allows for a one minute timed window for landing back on the field. Changes to this playlist for this parameter will only take effect when the playlist is regenerated.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Between Rounds
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											If you wish for there to be some time between rounds, this is a selection where you can insert time. Changes to this playlist for this parameter will only take effect when the playlist is regenerated.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Announce Pilots In Next Round
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											This is to announce the next round pilots at approximately 3:25 left in the window of the current round. This is to help pilots remember that they are up in the next round and should start to get ready. This can also be turned on and off on the fly without re generating the playlist.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Announce Pilot Score Reminders
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											This is to announce a list of pilots that have not yet entered their self scoring scores. It happens at the beginning of a new round, and looks at anything older than 2 rounds ago to announce the pilots to be reminded.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Call Out Pilot Score Reminder Now Button
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											This button will immediately announce a list of pilots that have not yet entered their self scoring scores and looks at anything older than 1 rounds ago to announce the pilots to be reminded.

										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											This is the list of serial ports that have been found on your computer. If you do not see any (except None), then plug in your serial cable adapter (USB to serial cable) and use the refresh button.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Serial Port Refresh button
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											This is the recycle image next to the serial port dropdown list. Clicking on this will re-load the serial port list and close the serial port connection. You can then select a new serial port if it shows up. If it does not show up in the list, then you may have to look at the drivers for your USB to serial cable.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>Protocol
										<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
											This is which protocol to use when sending data to a particular timing board. If you do not find the protocol on this list that works with your board, then please contact me, and we can create one that works.

							Underneath the audio playlist is a checbox that will repeat the playlist when it gets to the end. This makes it easy if you wish to use the playlist to repeat a task for practice.

		<li>Upgrading the Software :
			<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
				Periodically I will release updates to the software.<br>
				<br>
				The software does not have any automatic upgrading functionality, so when updating, simply delete the installation you have, and re-download the software like you initially have.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Considerations</h2>
		<p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12px;">
			As with any written software, there can be bugs in any cases that we have not tested for. If you come across any issues with the software, please contact me, and I can attempt to help with fixes or workarounds. There are also possibly issues with different computers and operating system versions that can arise. I will do my best, but if you report an issue, please let me know as much about your setup as possible.<br>
			<br>
			And as always, donations are welcome at any time <a href="#" onClick="document.donate.submit();">Here</a><br>

		Thanks,<br>
